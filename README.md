## Search Engine


This multi-threaded search engine utilizes web crawler, which crawls through a given link and parses out the HTML. It searches and stores all the text into an inverted index data structure that keeps track of each word's position, frequency, and page number.

This program will also execute a partial search (or full search) based on a query input, and returns results in order from most to least relevant. Relevancy is determined base on the position and frequency of a word. The search result will be displayed using HTML back to the user.
